\description{
\code{fetch_former_roles_for_member} fetches data on the former committee
roles of a given member and returns it as a tibble containing one row per
committee role.
}
\details{
A role indicates a period of service in a given position, so this function
returns the member's the former roles. A role without an end date is a
current role.

A member may have concurrent roles for the same period reflecting different
positions e.g. one indicating their service as a member and another their
service as a chair.
