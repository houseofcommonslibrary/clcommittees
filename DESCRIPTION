Description: This package provides a collection of functions for downloading
    data from the different endpoints of the UK Parliament's Committees 
    Information System API. The package currently focusses on the Committees
    and Members endpoints. It also provides a lower level API that makes it 
    easier to retreive data from any Committees API URL as a tibble of tidy 
    data.
